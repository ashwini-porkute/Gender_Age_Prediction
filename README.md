# Gender Age Prediction using Keras Functional model.
# (Model with 1 input and 2 outputs)

Provided requirements.txt for environmental packages or libraries needed to execute the script.

Note: Please run the script on good RAM system as it may get killed while training due to out of memory issues.

# Download Dataset: 
UTKFace Dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new/)


# Steps:
1. Import Libraries
2. Converting Dataset to Pandas Dataframe.
3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. Converting Dataframes to numpy array as keras model supports numpy arrays as input.
5. Normalizing data and categorizing in dependant and independant category.
6. Model Creation
7. Model Visualization.
8. Compiling model with loss, optimizer and metrics to be used.
9. Training the model with batch size, epochs etc.
10. Plot the loss and accuracy graphs to check the performance of the model.
11. Predicting the output.
